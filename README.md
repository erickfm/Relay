# RELAY: Universal Desktop Assistant

A vision-guided automation system that executes arbitrary computer tasks through natural language commands. Tell it "make a dad rock playlist on Spotify" or "fill out this checkout form with my usual info" and it handles the entire workflow by seeing your screen and taking the same actions a human would.

## üöÄ Features

- **Pure Vision-Based**: Works with any application - desktop software, web browsers, games, utilities
- **Natural Language Commands**: Simple English descriptions of what you want done
- **Real-Time Narration**: See exactly what RELAY is thinking and doing
- **Safety Controls**: Emergency stop, confirmation prompts, and action allowlists
- **Failure Recovery**: Intelligent diagnosis and adaptation when things go wrong
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Modern Package Management**: Uses `uv` for fast, reliable dependency management

## üéØ Core Mechanism

RELAY uses OpenAI GPT-4V to analyze desktop screenshots, plan appropriate actions, and generate PyAutoGUI automation scripts. The system:

1. Takes a screenshot of your screen
2. Asks GPT-4V "what should I do next to accomplish this task?"
3. Executes the returned mouse/keyboard commands
4. Verifies progress by taking another screenshot
5. Repeats until the task is complete

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Architecture

- **Confirmation Prompts**: High-risk actions like purchases or deletions require user confirmation
- **Emergency Stop**: Move mouse to screen corner or press emergency stop button
- **Action Allowlists**: Prevents unauthorized system modifications
- **Session Isolation**: Tasks don't interfere with each other
- **Confidence Scoring**: Low-confidence actions trigger alternative approaches

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key with GPT-4V access
- Screen recording permissions
- Accessibility permissions (for automation)
- `uv` package manager (automatically installed by install script)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Automated Installation (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/relay.git
cd relay

# Run the installation script
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The installation script will:
- Install `uv` if not present
- Set up all dependencies
- Create configuration directory
- Guide you through API key setup
- Test the installation

### Option 2: Manual Installation

#### 1. Install uv

```bash
# Install uv package manager
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Restart your shell or source the environment
source ~/.cargo/env
```

#### 2. Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/relay.git
cd relay

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

#### 3. Set Up API Key

Set your OpenAI API key in one of these ways:

**Environment Variable:**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

**Configuration File:**
Create `~/.relay/config.json`:
```json
{
  "openai_api_key": "your-api-key-here",
  "model": "gpt-4-vision-preview",
  "max_iterations": 50,
  "max_failures": 10,
  "confidence_threshold": 3
}
```

#### 4. Run RELAY

```bash
# Run the main application
uv run python main.py

# Or use the relay command
uv run relay
```

### 5. Grant Permissions

When prompted, grant:
- Screen recording permissions
- Accessibility permissions (for automation)

## üéÆ Usage

1. **Enter a Task**: Describe what you want RELAY to do in natural language
2. **Watch It Work**: See real-time narration of what RELAY is thinking and doing
3. **Stay in Control**: Pause, stop, or take over at any time
4. **Emergency Stop**: Move mouse to screen corner or press emergency stop button

### Example Tasks

- "Make a dad rock playlist on Spotify"
- "Fill out this checkout form with my usual info"
- "Organize my desktop files into folders"
- "Navigate to my email and compose a new message"
- "Complete this online purchase with my saved payment info"

### Core Components

- **Vision Engine**: Analyzes screenshots with GPT-4V and plans actions
- **Automation Engine**: Executes mouse/keyboard actions with safety controls
- **Task Controller**: Orchestrates the complete automation workflow
- **Main Window**: Modern UI with real-time narration and controls

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Configuration is stored in `~/.relay/config.json`:

```json
{
  "openai_api_key": "your-key",
  "model": "gpt-4-vision-preview",
  "max_iterations": 50,
  "max_failures": 10,
  "confidence_threshold": 3,
  "safety": {
    "emergency_stop_enabled": true,
    "confirmation_required": ["delete", "purchase", "confirm", "submit"]
  }
}

uv run pytest -m unit
uv run pytest -m integration
uv run pytest -m "not slow"
```

## üì¶ Package Management with uv

RELAY uses `uv` for fast, reliable Python package management:

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Add a new dependency
uv add package-name

# Add development dependency
uv add --dev package-name

# Update dependencies
uv sync --upgrade

# Run commands in the project environment
uv run python main.py
uv run pytest
uv run black .
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Cannot take screenshots"**
- Grant screen recording permissions in System Preferences/Settings
- On macOS: System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Screen Recording

**"Accessibility permissions required"**
- Grant accessibility permissions for automation
- On macOS: System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility

**"OpenAI API key not found"**
- Set environment variable: `export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"`
- Or enter it when prompted on first run

**"uv command not found"**
- Install uv: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- Restart your shell or run: `source ~/.cargo/env`

**"Task fails repeatedly"**
- Check if the target application is responsive
- Try simpler, more specific task descriptions
- Check logs in `~/.relay/logs/relay.log`

### Logs

Logs are stored in `~/.relay/logs/relay.log` and include:
- Task execution details
- Action success/failure information
- Error diagnostics
- Performance metrics

## üîí Security & Privacy

- **Local Execution**: All automation runs locally on your machine
- **No Data Collection**: RELAY doesn't collect or transmit personal data
- **API Usage**: Only screenshots are sent to OpenAI for analysis
- **Session Isolation**: Each task runs in isolation
- **Emergency Controls**: Multiple ways to stop automation immediately
